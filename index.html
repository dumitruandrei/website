  <h1>Andrei Georgian Dumitru</h1>
  <p>
    I am a senior Computer Science student at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
    I was born and raised in Romania and came to the US to study.
  </p>
  <p>
    I chose CS early in high school when I started practicing algorithms. I
    participated in many algorithm competitions (both online and on site) and I felt
    like CS was the right field for me. At some point I got quite bored of solving
    algorithmic challenges every day, so I tried to get involved in “real life”
    projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    I got to do some hackathons, independent studies with professors at IIT, and
    internships (in Software Engineering). I will graduate in May 2018 and won’t go
    to grad school. I am not a fan of research jobs and I feel like it’s useless to
    do a master to gain engineering experience instead of just practicing an
    engineering job.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy software engineering and I did a good amount of back end work in C++,
    Java, and Python. I always avoid designing pages and user interfaces, but I feel
    it's about the time to understand the basics of that. I hope that by the end of
    this semester I will know at least the basics of HTML and CSS and I will be able
    to design simple web pages that work fine on any type of screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not in class I usually like going out with friends and practicing some
    sports. My favorite sport is, by far, swimming, but I also enjoy bowling, ping
    pong, and ice skating.
